This project was created as a personal project during my time studying at DevMountain. It was planned, coded and hosted in just under three weeks. 

Project Purpose: Gain experience designing and creating a full CRUD app from scratch.

Personal Project Goals: 
    Implement two technologies NOT taught in the course.
    Provide a solution to a real-world problem.
    Create an app that could be scaled up to include many more features at a later date.

Technologies Used:
HTML | REACT | REDUX | STRIPE | NODEMAILER | AUTH0 | JAVASCRIPT | PostgreSQL 

Project Function:
This app was designed to function as a tool for a junkyard business. Junkyards often allow customers to scour the yard for parts that they would like to buy. Junkyards don't keep a very specific inventory, so customers looking for parts don't currently have the option to search online. They have to physically visit the junkyard and are often disappointed to find that the part they are looking for is not there.

The Junkyard-Waitlist app allows a junkyard to simply input the year, make, model and color of the vehicles when they arrive. Users are able to visit the site and indicate vehicles for which they would like to find parts. When the junkyard receives an anticipated vehicle, an email is automatically generated and sent to the given user. A secondary feature is that basic users only get notified after 24 hours, incentivizing them to upgrade to a premium account so they get notified immediately (for testing purposes, the delay is set to 5 min instead of 24 hours). Additionally, users are able to search the full inventory including the date the vehicle was input.
